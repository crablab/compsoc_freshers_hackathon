# CompSoc Challenges

Written for 2018 Freshers Hackathon in a few hours. Many bugs, not written very well. 

## API Keys + passwords

They exist in the commit history, yes they have been rolled. 

## Set up 

1) Stick your MailGun details and MySQL username and password in `congfig.php`
2) Set up your webserver to force all requests to `public/index.php` 

## Todo 

1) Make the stage creation less janky (ie. have a table stage information)
2) Improve stage detection within a stage (ie. they have a concept of where you actually are)

## Issues + PRs

All are appreciated. No gurantees.
